Setup Connection to IPC unix domain socket server (this acts as the client), and the 
send some hardcoded data. The issue is that before we were reading user input from std in, and sending that (ASCII)
data to the receiver, but now we need to send binary data. 

Usage:
    cargo run --bin ipc_burst_hardcoded <name of target>
